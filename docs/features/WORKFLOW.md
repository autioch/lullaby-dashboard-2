# Feature pipeline — shared rules for agents

Grounding and cross-cutting rules for every pipeline command — `/spec`, `/plan`, `/implement`,
and `/reconcile`. Each command reads this first, then does its own job. The shared rules live
**here** (not copied into each command file) so there's a single source of truth — edit this, not
each command.

```text
/spec  →  /plan  →  /implement          idea → contract → plan → code
                        │
                        └─ validate / review:  /verify · /code-review · /simplify · /security-review
/reconcile  ……  re-sync an implemented spec with the code once it has drifted
```

## Grounding reads

Read what's relevant before acting; don't re-explore the whole repo.

- [.github/copilot-instructions.md](../../.github/copilot-instructions.md) — house rules, stack, TV / Chrome 87 floor, environment (always loaded; don't restate it).
- [.github/instructions/development.instructions.md](../../.github/instructions/development.instructions.md) — architecture, source layout, conventions, command table, **Adding a feature**, **Keeping docs in sync**.
- [docs/07_data-architecture.md](../07_data-architecture.md) — the layering authority.
- Product / design context, mainly for `/spec`: [docs/01_vision.md](../01_vision.md), [docs/04_design-principles.md](../04_design-principles.md), [docs/05_design.md](../05_design.md).
- The actual source the work touches — record types in `src/database/*`, the relevant stores / repos / components — before assuming how it works.

## Rules for every pipeline command

- **House style:** short, direct, precise (per copilot-instructions "Working style"). The spec and plan are contracts — unambiguous, no filler.
- **Respect the layering:** Firestore → repository → store → component. Repos are the only Firestore callers; logic lives in stores, not components; **never mutate Zustand after a write** (let `onSnapshot` flow it back). See `docs/07`.
- **TV-first + Chrome 87 floor:** large, high-contrast, D-pad-operable UI; no client JS/CSS newer than Chrome 87 (`compat/compat`). Server / API-route code is off-floor. See copilot-instructions.
- **Docs are part of the change:** follow the dev guide's **Keeping docs in sync** map; never ship code and prose that disagree.
- **Specs state current + target state, not history** — no "added / removed / used to". The git log carries the change history.
- **Don't invent decisions only the user can make** — ask (multiple-choice, recommended option first), then record the resolution back into the spec / plan so the contract stays the single source of truth.
- **Don't duplicate** code, docs, or spec content that already exists — extend the canonical example (dev guide **"Copy from"**) and reference it rather than restate.

## Validation & review

The gate is `npm run ci` (tsc + lint incl. `compat/compat` + format); `npm run verify` auto-fixes
then re-checks; `npm run build` confirms compilation. Beyond the gate, use the built-in skills
rather than re-inventing them:

- **`/verify`** — run the app and confirm behavior against the spec's **Acceptance criteria** (TV user agent for UI).
- **`/code-review`** — correctness bugs + reuse / simplification / efficiency over the change.
- **`/simplify`** — quality-only cleanup (reuse, simplification, efficiency); no bug hunting.
- **`/security-review`** — when the change touches auth, an API route, or `tools/firestore.rules`.
