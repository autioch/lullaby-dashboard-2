Record of the third post-review adjustment round. The spec, plan, and implementation record are
**frozen** — this file plus rounds [1](01_adjust_content-editing-r1.md) and
[2](01_adjust_content-editing-r2.md) are the only record of post-review changes. Every claim
traces to a commit.

## Change requests

Classification is one of: **requirement change** · **refactor** · **design change**.

### CR-1 — Fully square UI

- **Source:** Design — Jakub Szczepaniak
- **Request:** The whole UI should be square — no rounded corners anywhere.
- **Why:** Consistency with the app's square, minimalistic look (round 2 squared the buttons; other
  elements were still rounded).
- **Classification:** design change.
- **How handled:** Removed every remaining `border-radius` (auth input, editor error / rows /
  inputs / row-swatch / palette swatches, and the unused `.c-button--text` variant). Only
  `ProgressBar`'s `border-radius: inherit` remains, which resolves to 0 with no rounded ancestor.
- **Acceptance check:** No rounded corners in the app.
- **Result:** Implemented — verified on the SmartTV UA (screenshots): inputs, buttons, swatches and
  the colour trigger are square. Commit `f9e89e6`.

### CR-2 — Compact, single-row objective editor

- **Source:** Product owner / Design — Jakub Szczepaniak
- **Request:** The inline objective editor (round 2) takes too much space. Drop the input's field
  label; make colour selection a popup/dropdown; make the hidden button contain its own state label
  instead of an external label; the editor should fit in one (max two) rows.
- **Why:** Density — the four stacked field blocks per objective made the group list very long.
- **Classification:** requirement + design change.
- **How handled:** Rewrote `ObjectiveEditor` as a single flex row: a plain label `input` (no field
  label), a new compact `ColorField` (a swatch trigger that opens a small popup of the palette;
  closed it is one swatch button), a new `HiddenToggle` whose own text shows the state
  (Visible / Hidden — `visible` / `hidden` strings), then Move ↑/↓ and Delete. `ColorField` and
  `HiddenToggle` were added to `fields.tsx`, replacing the labelled `SwatchPicker` (removed); the
  now-unused `fieldColor` string and `__swatches` style were dropped. Field edits still feed the
  group's batched draft; Move/Delete stay immediate.
- **Acceptance check:** No field labels per objective; colour via a popup; hidden button shows its
  state; each objective fits in one (max two) rows.
- **Result:** Implemented — verified on the SmartTV UA: each objective is one row (label · colour
  trigger · "Widoczne/Ukryte" toggle · Move · Delete); the colour popup opens with the 6 square
  swatches and picking closes it (verified pick → close with no dirty change). Commit `c07b484`.

### CR-3 — Disabled buttons show a loading cursor (bug)

- **Source:** Development — Jakub Szczepaniak
- **Request:** Disabled buttons show the loading (`wait`) cursor; that's wrong.
- **Why:** A non-applicable disabled control implied a pending action.
- **Classification:** refactor (bug fix).
- **How handled:** Changed the `:disabled` cursor from `wait` to `not-allowed` on `.c-button` and
  the editor glyph/colour-trigger buttons.
- **Acceptance check:** Disabled buttons show `not-allowed`, not a loading cursor.
- **Result:** Implemented — verified on the SmartTV UA: a disabled button's computed `cursor` is
  `not-allowed`. Commit `e3afa79`.

### CR-4 — Root action should say "Close", not "Back"

- **Source:** Design — Jakub Szczepaniak
- **Request:** On the missions list (root), the header button should suggest closing the editor, not
  going back.
- **Why:** At the root the action closes the overlay, so "Back" was misleading.
- **Classification:** design change.
- **How handled:** `Header` shows `contentEditor.close` ("Close" / "Zamknij") when `isRoot`, else
  `contentEditor.back`; behaviour unchanged (root closes, deeper levels go back).
- **Acceptance check:** Root reads "Close"/"Zamknij" and closes; deeper levels read "Back".
- **Result:** Implemented — verified on the SmartTV UA: the missions root shows "Zamknij". Commit
  `5df678c`.

## Verification

- **Gate:** `npm run ci` (tsc + ESLint incl. `compat/compat` + Prettier) green; `npm run build`
  succeeds.
- **Original acceptance criteria (no regression):** re-walked on the SmartTV UA — editor opens from
  the menu and closes; create/rename/delete reachable; editable fields work (objective fields now
  via the compact controls into the group's batched save); Move ↑/↓ with correct end-disabling;
  delete confirm; keyboard/D-pad operable with the 4px focus ring; `tools/firestore.rules`
  untouched. No console errors.
- **New acceptance checks:** CR-1…CR-4 each confirmed (see Result lines).
- **Review skills:** `/code-review` (no surviving correctness findings) and `/simplify` (clean —
  `ColorField` / `HiddenToggle` are clean extractions, dead `SwatchPicker` / `__swatches` /
  `fieldColor` removed). `/security-review` **not triggered** — no auth, API route, or
  `tools/firestore.rules` change this round.
